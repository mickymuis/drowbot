%%% Start:
=== Initial position
Move to the top left corner of drawing area and reset steps

Measure top side (a) and the length of the chains (mm).
a = length between motors
b = left chain
c = right chain

Heron's to get height sy then use that to calculate sx.
 s = (a + b + c)/2.0
 A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
   = (a * sy)/2.0
sy = (2.0 * A)/a
sx = sqrt(b * b - sy * sy)

=== Second calibration: (Only needs to happen once)
Move in a way that changes the left chain length (a lot)
Measure left chain again
Determine steps/measured units (mm)
Convert a, b, c, sx, sy into a step based system
The max x pos is now clear (a - sx - some margin)

%%% Operation:
=== Getting chain lengths for some (x, y) inside area
   a = top length (steps)
x, y = coordinates inside area
p, q = xs + x, ys + y
   b = sqrt(p * p + q * q)
   c = sqrt(((a - p) * (a - p) + q * q)

Smoothing movement is probably going to be based on a
pre-defined timescale (800Hz-ish) and then moving is
based in 200-400Hz so we can hopefully have smooth-ish
movement for most of the required movements we will do.

%%% Demonstration:
After calibration we move it down to 0,(w/e low spot)
Drowbot some boxes or lines to contain the initial state
Have some audience member fill them
Let someone else pick a rules nr (from a set of good ones)?
