%TODO: Actually write this


Doing an art might be hard, but what if robots and stuff.
A ground-breaking project for sure, as in the ground might break if the
suspended platform drops when the motors lose power.

%%% Original abstract from long ago
% There exist many different drawing- and writing robots. Examples
% include Axibot [1] or [2]. The most common constructions are either arm-based
% (single arm holding a pen) or have a plotter/CNC-style three-axis position pen.
% Practical implementation often utilize the GCode protocol to send drawing
% instructions to the robot; the robot itself lacks any ‘intelligence’, which basically
% makes it a printer/plotting-device. The ‘Maestrobot’ differentiates itself by being
% able to create its output untethered. It is equipped not only with a pen/marking-
% tool, but also with a simple optical sensor (infrared-led-photodiode). Using
% this sensor, the Maestrobot can ‘see’ what is already on the paper and use this
% information to decide where/what to draw next. Different algorithms could
% be suitable to add ‘intelligence’ to the robot’s drawing expertise. For example,
% cellular automata could be used to finish a given start sequence or the input could
% be combined with Perlin noise to create interesting textures. Eventually the
% robot could be used to perform certain difficult or tedious tasks in human-made
% art. These include repeating structures, fractals or extremely fine lines, given an
% algorithm specified by the artist.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

While some might consider drawing a distinctly human art form,
many tools have been devised to assist in the process.
In recent years there has been a shift to digital with drawing
tablets and drawing software and it is not unusual for a drawing
to never exist outside of the digital realm.
This digital realm is very convenient, but why stop there.
Our increasingly digital lives have brought us electronics that
allow the digital to act in the real world, including the robot.

Many drawing robots have been devised to automate tedious and
repetitive parts of the artistic process.
These include drawings arms and three-axis CNC-like solutions that
act as some form of plotter.
But we believe that robots do not have to be deterministic plotters
and wanted to see if they could interact with artwork and produce
drawings without pre-programmed or direct control.
Is it viable to give a drawing robot some agency to produce some
form of art on its own.

\section{Project Overview}
\label{sec:overview}
% Description and goals of the project

We set out to create a drawing robot that is partially controlled by
optical feedback.
With our limited amount of time and a live prototype presentation
on the horizon we had to set some constraints to make this possible.

Given that the live demo was in a classroom the only viable drawing
surface was the blackboard as transporting a large amount of surface
to draw on was infeasible.

Using the vertically mounted blackboard as surface and chalk as
end-effector left us with a single viable approach.
A suspended drawing platform attached to the top corners of the
blackboard using cables.
If we can vary the cable lengths and give the platform a way to
disengage the chalk from the blackboard we end up with three
degrees of freedom.
We also put a camera on the platform as a means to gather the
optical feedback we required.
We will elaborate more on the specifics of the design in the next
section and some even more details specifics can be found in the
appendix.

\subsection*{Related work and inspiration}
Naturally we are not the first to use this suspended end-effector
approach for a drawing robot.
They are usually called polar plotters after their internal use
of bipolar coordinates, which we will cover later on.
While we used no code from any of these existing projects, we did
lift some physical design inspiration from them.
% TODO: figure out how to cite an in-document bibliography without warnings
The Polargraph \cite{polargraphsite} in particular served as
inspiration for the cables and how to drive them with the motors.

%%% Code dependencies are probably pointless to list tbh
% The only library dependency of our code is the PIGPIO library for
% simplified GPIO and help with timing our signals, but replacing
% this would not be particularly hard.
% We also used the V4L2 drivers for the raspberry PI camera in order
% to grab images through the file descriptor interface.

\section{Physical Design}
\label{sec:design}
Our prototype has a large physical presence as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}.
In this section we will try and give an overview of the parts involved
while there is a more elaborate description in appendix \ref{sec:buildinst}.

\subsection*{Motors and cables}
% There is no better place to start than the reason why it (usually)
% does not fall apart.
The main body of these assemblies is mounted to the blackboard and
contains a stepper motor and a 3D printed pulley for the beaded chain.
We used the beaded chain because it is relatively light and very
easy to hold firmly on a pulley to make sure it only moves when
we want it to.

One end of the chains holds an easily adjustable counterweight,
a water bottle in this case, while the other holds the platform.
On the platform side the chain is attached to a 3D printed handle
that slips on a ball bearing around the tube that holds the chalk.

You can find designs for the 3D printed objects on GitHub\cite{github}.

\subsection*{The suspended platform}
This platform is attached to the same chalk tube that we attached
the chains to.
It holds a good chunk of the electronics, like the Raspberry Pi Zero W
that we use to drive the entire thing and the camera attached to it
to gather optical feedback.
The board ``glides'' on the blackboard using nylon bolts as a form of
standoff.
Disconnecting the chalk to stop drawing is achieved by a mechanism
mounted right above the tube that pushes the platform away from the
blackboard using a servo.
To counteract the weight of the servo on the top of the platform
we added some weight to the bottom.

To get power for the Pi and servo, and send control signals to the
motors up top we needed to run 7 separate lines, so we made a
custom shield with an RJ45 jack on it so we could run Cat 5e
cable to carry all of them.

\subsection*{Motor drivers and power delivery}
On the other end of that Cat 5e cable is another piece of protoboard,
the final piece of our design puzzle.

Controlling a stepper motor is something you usually hand off to some
specialised circuitry and in our case we used two DRV8825 drivers.
These drivers allowed us to use a separate stronger power supply for
the motors while the rest of our electronics used a USB power supply.
This proved very useful when we needed to switch to stronger motors
to move and even hold the heavy platform.


\section{Functionality}
\label{sec:functionality}
While the physical design is impressive, the only thing it can do
without software is hold its place on the board.
The actual software component for this project is very light since
driving the system is essentially just moving the servo between
two preset positions and telling the drivers when to step and in
which direction.

We will start this section by covering the core functionality and the
demo we built on top of that, before moving on to a short explanation
of some of the maths involved in the background.

\subsection{Core functionality}
The Drowbot can interpret a section of the blackboard as a grid
and move feely within it using normal Cartesian coordinates.
For our demo we only use a very simple interface with a single
command telling it to move to specific coordinates while specifying
if it should draw or lift the chalk from the board, but much more
elaborate systems are technically in reach.

  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{1D cellular automaton}

% TODO: cite stuff?
We wanted a demonstration that shows a possible application of the
optical feedback provided by the camera and with our relatively
simple movement interface something simple like a one dimensional
cellular automaton is a perfect fit.
So we start by drawing some boxes on the board which can then be
filled to provide a visual representation of the initial state.
After someone has created the initial state we reactivate the
Drowbot and it will read the initial state with the camera.
A user is then invited to enter a Wolfram code of their liking
and the drowbot will then start drawing the rest of the generations
while using the user provided initial state and rule.

An image of a resulting drawing can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ca_res}.
The boxes are filled with a Z pattern to save time while drawing.
There are some extra diagonal lines in the image because the system
for lifting the chalk to stop drawing was not perfectly tuned.

\subsubsection*{Dragon curve}

% TODO: cite stuff?
As it turns out our simple movement interface is very similar to
turtle graphics and we can emulate most of the turtle graphics
functionality with it.
We wanted to show off how this robot can help people with drawing
repetitive structures like fractals, so we ported the turtle
graphics code for the dragon curve to run on the Drowbot.

The resulting image before we ran out of drawing space can be
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:drag_curve}.


\subsection{Maths}
% TODO: CITE STUFF? (a.k.a. link to wikipedia for some terms)

To elaborate on the maths we have provided a small example image
in Figure~\ref{fig:maths}.
These maths are in no way advanced, but we think they are interesting
enough to warrant explaining.
They also make for a fun example.

\begin{figure}[t]
% \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.45\textwidth}
  \centering
  % \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/drowbot-maths.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img/drowbot-maths.eps}
  \caption{Example}
  \label{fig:maths}
% \end{wrapfigure}
\end{figure}

We colour coded the labels and lines in the example and will now
explain what they represent.
The black labels represent fixed constant values with $L$ and $R$
representing the stepper motors, and $Top$ the distance between them.
The blue $Left$ and $Right$ represent the chain lengths, which are
the only variables we control directly.
The red $P$ represents the platform at position $(X,Y)$ in Cartesian
coordinates.
One of the nice constraints in this case is that $P$ will never be
left of $L$ or right of $R$ and will always be below $L$ and $R$ due
to gravity. This helps simplify the calculations a bit.

Through calibration and manual measurement we know the lengths $Top$,
$Left$, and $Right$ and can use those to calculate the coordinates
for point $P$.
We shall start with $Y$, the height of the triangle $L,R,P$.

Getting the height of a triangle with known side lengths is simple.
We start with Heron's formula to calculate its area:
$$s = \frac{Top + Left + Right}{2}$$
$$Area = \sqrt{s(s-Top)(s-Left)(s-Right)}$$
%
Now we can solve the equation for the area of a triangle for the height:
$$Area = \frac{height \times base}{2} = \frac{Y \times Top}{2}$$
$$Y = \frac{2 \times Area}{Top}$$
%
We can then obtain the position of $X$ using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$X = \sqrt{Left^2 - Y^2}$$

Now that we know how to get from side length to coordinates we can
also go in the opposite direction and calculate how long $Left$ and
$Right$ need to be to get $P$ to a given $X,Y$.
This is another simple application of the Pythagorean theorem:
$$Left = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2},\ Right = \sqrt{(Top - X)^2 + Y^2}$$

The interface we used for our demonstration was based on moving
in straight lines between two positions in the Cartesian coordinate
system, which is not as trivial as it might seem.
In the project overview we mentioned that polar plotters use a
bipolar coordinate system internally, which is a system that uses
the distances from two fixed centres to the target point as the
coordinates.

In our case that means that our internal position of $P$ is not
$(X,Y)$, but actually the integer values for $(Left,Right)$
which most closely approximate what would be the position $(X,Y)$
that the user provided.

This disconnect means that moving from one Cartesian coordinate
to another in a straight line does not translate in a smooth linear
change for the bipolar system.
Sadly we lacked the time to properly analyse and solve this in an
elegant fashion so we went with the other approach to change the
straight line into a series of small line segments in Cartesian
coordinates and translating those to bipolar coordinates so the
overall movement seems to be straight.
Even though we did not use any microstepping for our prototype
while our drivers did support it we already had a resolution of
about half a millimetre per step and considering how relatively
inaccurate chalk is the difference between this interpolation
and an actual straight line is absolutely invisible.

\section{Conclusion and discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
% TODO: rewrite all of this when I'm slightly more sane

In some miraculous fashion we managed to achieve all the lofty goals
we set for this project.
We have a functioning drawing robot that can read something from
the blackboard and act based on whatever it saw on its own without
direct input.

This project was a lot of fun, but it also ended up costing both
member a large part of the month we spent creating this.
Almost every step of the way we faced a new setback and almost all
of the initial parts of the design were replaced in the process.
The end result worked so much better than we could have dreamt
especially after all the setback so in a way the time investment
might have been worth it.
We did end up with a working drawing robot after all.
Future work includes removing it from its blackboard and chalk
constraints and see what it can do in an environment that is
more controlled and easier to move in.
